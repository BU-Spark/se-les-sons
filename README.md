# Les Sons

Les Sons is a mobile app targeted at beginning French learners to learn French pronunciation and how to read any French words. The app provides textual information and audio files on French pronunciation following Alainâ€™s extensive experience teaching French. 

The content of the mobile app is based on a book written by Alain (a longtime french language instructor) which he has developed over the last 20 years. We adapted the content of the book to a mobile format, designing various UX elements and user interaction flows from lo-fi wireframes in order to best display the content

In addition to the written content each section has several recordings of various French words and sounds that need to be integrated into the app, as well as allowing users to record their own production of the sounds in order to compare and improve on their pronunciation.


## Install and Run

Install flutter following this [guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). You will need to install Xcode, and cocoapods to set up the IOS simulator. To set up andriod you will need to install andriod studio, and andriod tookchain. All of the dependencies are explained in the guide.   

Then go to our [github](https://github.com/BU-Spark/se-les-sons/tree/dev) and fork the repository. 

Then clone the repo. Open your terminal, go to the path where you want to have your repo on your local machine.
```
git clone <ssh-url>
```
Enter the clone repo, cd se-les-sons

Check remote 
```
git remote -v
```
You should see url of your repository. Something like
```
https://github.com/<your_github_account_name>/<repository_name>.git
```
Add upstream to remote 
```
git remote add upstream <upstream repo link>
i.e git remote add upstream git@github.com:BU-Spark/se-les-sons.git
```

Check remote again 
```
git remote -v
```
 Now you should see two remotes, namely `upstream` and `origin`. Verify if the urls are corect. `upstream` should be our repo url. `origin` should be your repo url.

 To run 
 ```
 flutter run
 ```
